# Gulp Playground

This starter project uses Gulp for compile all of our assets.  
To get started:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NDOY3M4N/gulp-playground
cd gulp-playground
```

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building for production

When you are ready to deploy your app, you can run the following  
```bash
npm run prod
```

It will optimze everything you need for your static website. You can now publish the ```public``` folder to your preferred hosting service.
